#Financial Statement Analysis

#Scenario: You are a Data Scientist working for a consulting firm. One of your colleagues from the
#Auditing department has asked you to help them assess the financial statement of organisation X.

#You have been supplied with two vectors of data:monthly revenue and monthly expenses for the financial
#year in question. Your task is to calculate the following financial metrics:

#  -profit for each month
#  -profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
#  -profit margin for each month - equals to profit after tax divided by revenue
#  -good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
#  -bad months - where the profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
#  -the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
#  -the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year
#==================================================================================================

# All results need to be presented as vectors.
# Results for dollar values need to be calculated with $0.01 precision, but need to be presented in 
# Units of $1,000 (i.e. lk) with no decimal points.

# Results for the profit margin ratio need to be presented in units % with no decimal points.
# Note: Your colleague has warned you that is OK for tax for any given month to be negative
# (in accounting terms, negative tax translates into a deferred tax asset)

#data is on superdatascience.com

revenue <- c(14574.49, 7606.46, 8611.41, 9175.41, 8058.65, 8105.44, 11496.28, 9766.09, 10305.32, 14379.96, 10713.97, 15433.50)
expenses <- c(12051.82, 5695.07, 12319.20, 12089.72, 8658.57, 840.20, 3285.73, 5821.12, 6976.93, 16618.61, 10054.37, 3803.96)

#Solution
typeof(revenue)

# -profit for each month
# the formula for calculating profit is Profit = Revenue - Expenses
# where Revenue is the total income generated for the month.  Expenses are the total costs incurred for the month.
profit <-  revenue - expenses
